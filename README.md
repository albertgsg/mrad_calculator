# Milliradian calculator
## Radian (RAD) / Milliradian (MRAD or Mil)
One radian (RAD) is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius

Length of a circle L = 2 x π x R, therefore a circle (360º) has 6,283 RAD's
- 1 RAD = 57,3º (180º/π or 360º/2π)
- 1 RMAD/Mil = 1/1000 of a RAD
- 1 MRAD/Mil = .0573º
- 1 MRAD/Mil = Angular distance of 1 meter at 1000 meters

## Ranging with MRAD
- Range (meters) = ( Target Size (meters) / Measured MRAD ) x 1000
- Range (meters) = ( Target Size (cm) / Measured MRAD ) x 10
